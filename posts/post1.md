# Building a Minimalist Blog

<div class="warning-callout">

When I set out to create this blog, I wanted something that would be both functional and aesthetically pleasing. The key principles I followed were:

1. **Simplicity**: Keep the design clean and focused on content
2. **Performance**: Load content dynamically to maintain fast initial page load
3. **Accessibility**: Ensure the content is readable and navigable

## Technical Implementation

The blog is built using vanilla JavaScript and CSS, with no heavy frameworks. Here's a snippet of the core functionality:

```javascript
async function loadPost(file) {
    const response = await fetch(file);
    const markdown = await response.text();
    return marked.parse(markdown);
}
```

This approach allows for:
- Fast initial page load
- Easy content updates
- Clean separation of concerns

## Future Enhancements

I'm considering adding:
- RSS feed support
- Dark/light mode toggle
- Reading time estimates

Stay tuned for updates!
