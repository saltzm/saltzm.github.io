# You don't have to answer the question

We tend to feel like questions need answers. When we're little kids, we ask "why?" until a frustrated parent says "just because!"

When we're older, we have worries and concerns. We think "What if she doesn't like me?", or "What if I said the wrong thing?" and then spend time trying to answer these questions so that we can feel satisfied or ease our concern.

It never occurred to me until I was 33 years old that these questions simply don't need answers. When I think these thoughts, I can just leave them be, as questions. And they pass just like that.

One of the most gripping questions we encounter when we're feeling unsatisfied is "What is the meaning of life?" The process tends to go like: things feel meaningless/we feel disatisfied/we had some belief that we lost  -> we think it's bad that things feel meaningless, and that the antidote to meaninglessness is meaning -> we search for meaning, trying to answer the question "What is the meaning of life?", hoping that the fealing of meaninglessness is like a hole that we can simply fill by putting an answer in it.

But it turns out that even "What is the meaning of life?" is just a question, and as ridiculous as it sounds, you don't need to answer it. I might argue that it's unanswerable, but that's beside the point. Even if there were some answer, it's okay to just let the question be as it is - an unanswered question.

Then the process is like: things feel meaningless -> we wonder "what's the meaning of life?" -> we eat breakfast -> we go to work -> we talk to friends. 

Or eventually: things feel meaningless -> we eat breakfast -> we go to work -> we talk to friends. We don't even take things feeling meaningless to be something bad.

And before we know it we've forgotten all about how things felt meaningless earlier.

For me sometimes when I wonder something like "What if I die tomorrow?" or "What if I get cancer?" or "What's my purpose?" I'll think, "Wow, that's a great question" and just move on with my day.

No one engaged in a great movie or a great conversation is at the same time questioning the meaning of life. It's a question that arises from dissatisfaction, or from the notion that life is a math problem that can or must somehow be solved. 

There's nothing wrong with discussing and pondering these things, or to consider what makes life *feel* meaningful. But I don't think it's actually necessary, and I think it's the feeling of necessity that makes these questions seem so heavy and important.

I think now that trying to resolve dissatisfaction is like trying to fill a hole when all you have is a shovel - you might be able to fill the hole, but you've just created a hole somewhere else. Instead, you can just step over the hole and keep walking.
